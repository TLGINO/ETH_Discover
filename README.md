# ETH Discover

## Idea:

Will try and see if it is feasible to "download" the blockchain directly from nodes, without running execution + consensus client, but instead by being a passive gossiper.

## So far:
Discovery works pretty well and I can (not activated) recursively connect to nodes and requested eth peers (IPs / ports) to connect to - hence building a map of ethereum.
